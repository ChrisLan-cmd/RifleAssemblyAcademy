        SAR 21 at a Glance
      </h2>
      <p>The SAR 21 (“Singapore Assault Rifle – 21st Century”) is Singapore’s bullpup assault rifle chambered for 5.56×45 mm NATO. Developed from 1995–1999 by MINDEF, the Singapore Army, and Chartered Industries of Singapore (now ST Engineering Land Systems), it replaced the M16S1 as the SAF’s standard service weapon in 1999.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sealed Reliability:</strong> Gas system and polymer parts resist salt, sand, and humidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Bullpup Ergonomics:</strong> Compact overall length without sacrificing barrel velocity; ambidextrous controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Built-in Stability:</strong> Integrated bipod and folding foregrip for rapid, steady aiming.</li>
        <li><strong>Optics-Ready:</strong> MIL-STD-1913 rail for scopes, lights, and other accessories.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond Singaporean service, the SAR 21 is exported globally via ST Kinetics and, in the U.S., through its subsidiary VT Systems.
